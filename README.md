# Commercial Banks in Bulgaria – Statistical Analysis

This project provides an analytical overview of the commercial banking sector in Bulgaria, based on official statistical data published by the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB).  
The analysis focuses on key financial indicators such as balance sheets, income statements, credits, deposits, and other structural metrics reported quarterly by all commercial banks operating in the country.

## Data Sources

All data used in this project is publicly available and retrieved directly from the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB):

[BNB – Financial Reports of Credit Institutions](https://www.bnb.bg/BankSupervision/BSCreditInstitution/BSCIFinansReports/BSCIFRForeignBanks/index.htm?forYear=2025)

- Balance Sheet and Income Statement datasets (quarterly)
- Credits and Deposits datasets (quarterly)
- Historical files following multiple format changes in BNB's reporting

These datasets are downloaded automatically via R scripts included in the project.  
The download logic accounts for the different file naming conventions used by BNB across periods (2004–present).
